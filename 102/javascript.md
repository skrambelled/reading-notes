# JavaScript

While HTML is the content layer and CSS is the presentation layer of a web page, JavaScript is the behaviour layer.

JavaScript allows you to dynamically interact with the user in a page.

JS is an object oriented language.

JS runs where it is found in the HTML.

```js
/* comment in JavaScript */
```

## How to use JavaScript

You will need to insert a `<script>` tag into your html, and then point that to your .js file using the src attribute.

## Variables

JS allows you to declare a variable and also assign it a value inline:

```js
var text = "This is a test!";
```

### Types

Javascript utilizes a few core data types for its variables:

- null
- boolean
- number
- string
- array
- function
- and of course, objects

All variables in JS are dynamically typed however you can use the `'using strict'` at the top of a .js file to force more tight control over data type comparisons and uses.

### Naming

- Variables must begin with a-z, $, or _ characters, and must -*NOT** start with a number.
- Can contain a number later, but **NOT** a `.` or `--
- Can **NOT** be a *keyword* or *reserved* name-
- Case sensitive-
- Should be conc-se, but also descriptive.
- shouldUseCamel-ase but start with lowercase, or use underscore_naming_style
