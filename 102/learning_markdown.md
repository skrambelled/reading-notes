This is a page to demonstrate some markdown techniques.

# This is a Heading, using the 1st header style.

## You may use a 2nd header style.

###### Or even up to a 6th header style!

You can make _italic text_, or **bold text**, or ~~strikethrough~~,  or _**combine them**_.

Lists may be unordered:
- some item
- another item
  - a child item, you have to indent this to the same layer as the parent item by adding enough spaces
    - You can keep going this way
      - its turtles all the way down
- something else

You could even order a list:
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
   1. A child item of item 2
3. Item 3

Links are simple, here is a link to my [reading notes](https://skrambelled.github.io/reading-notes/)

Here is an embedded image of Multnomha Falls from Wikipedia:

And to quote the falls (dramatized):
> gurgle, gurgle, gurgle

You can quickly insert a table using markdown, however this may be specific to GitHub.
