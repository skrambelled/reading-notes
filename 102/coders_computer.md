# A coder's computer
A coder's computer is one of the biggest tools in their toolkit. Its the bicycle for the brain, as Steve Jobs so aptly put.
Within the computer there are limitless tools, one of which is a text editor.

## Choosing a text editor
Text editors come in many flavors.
They may be as basic as Notepad in Windows, or Gedit in Linux. This is all you techinically need to edit plain text files and build projects, but they have no additional tools to help you keep organized, debug, or code efficiently.

- Notepad2 is a step up. It offers syntax highlighting, and some keyboard shortcuts for small operations, but still has very little beyond that.

- Notepad++ is another step up. It offers project organization tools and lots more.

- Visual Studio Code and Dreamwaver are exmples of IDE's (Integrated Development Environments). They offer a great deal more than the previously mentioned text editors, including debugging.

## Using the command line
- touch - create a file
- cd - change directory
- cp - copy a file
- mv - move a file
- ls - list a directory
- mkdir - make a directory
- rmdir - remove a directory
- pwd - print the present working directory
- code - open vs code
- brew - install programs
- git - gitflow commands
