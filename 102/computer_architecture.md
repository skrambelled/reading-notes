# Computer Architecture

Computers dont have to be electronic to be considered a computer. THey just have to be able to take input, store information, perform operations on that information, and output.

- Input information
- Store data
- Process or change data
- Output results

## Binary and data

Our modern computers only understand binary information, but we put layers of abstraction on top of that binary information so that we, the humans, can interact with computers in a meaningful way.

Binary numbers system is comprised of only 0 and 1 for its digits. Rather than 0 through 9 that we use in the decimal system.

## Circuits and logic

Circuits actually perform the processing of information. In coding we use _virtual circuits_ to manipulate information.

Some examples:
- not
- and
- adder
- many more

All operations of information in a computer has to use these simple circuits. Just lots and lots of them, very quickly.

## CPU, Memory, I/O

Devices takes input, like a mouse or keyboard, while other devices may provide output like speakers or a monitor.

The CPU handles the processing of information.

The Memory handles the storage of information.

## Hardware and Software

Hardware is the physical components of a computer, such as the CPU, HDD or SSD, RAM, etc.

Software is the code that runs on the machine.

The operating system is the layer that sits between hardware and software.
