## About Me

I am Mark Bell. I am a student at Code Fellows.
I am a hobbyist coder working on becoming a professional coder!
Additionally, I work in the food industry for the time being, and have many interests, namely wood working. I have been working on creating a woodshop in my garage in my spare time (which I expect to have very little of for a while.)

## Reflection on a Growth Mindset

A **growth mindset** is one of _progress_, rather than _stasis_. There will be ups and also downs when approaching life and, more specifically, coding from a growth mindet perspective and that is ok. You can take a step back for every two steps forward. You'll still be going in the direction of growth.

fixed mindset | growth mindset
------------- | --------------
avoid challenges rather than risk failure | embraces challenges, even if you fail it is still an opportunity to learn
gives up easily when challenged | persists through challenges
shuts out criticism | uses criticism to learn
threatend by others' success | uses others' success as a source of inspritation or building block
