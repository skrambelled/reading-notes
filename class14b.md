# Team Dynamics

Working in teams can have excellent results, teams tend to:

- Innovate faster
- Recognize mistakes faster
- Have better results
- Have better job satisfaction

Google, with its massive resources and analytics, set out to build the perfect team. And found all sorts of things. People who ate together, or rotated eating with various people in their team had better outcomes. Managers who avoided micro-managing had better outcomes for example. But also, team compisition and social overlapping did not seem to have any strong patterns to indicate the effectiveness of a given team. Some teams had nearly identical membership and drastically different outcomes. Or varying levels of management involvement, also with disparate outcomes.

One standout metric was that on good teams, everyone spoke roughly around the same amount. Meaning if everyone had an equal voice, the team performed well overall.

Another metric. When everyone in the team was sensitive to eachothers thoughts/mood/feelings the team performed better on average.

Teams optimized for individual performance did not do as well as teams optimized for group collaboration.

Teams that allow for open communication between members who respect eachother is the way to go over a team composed of the best and brightest.
