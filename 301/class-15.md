# The role of game marketting in the gender gap of the technology field

It is a well-established fact that that there are fewer women than men in the tech industrty.

An [article](https://qz.com/911737/silicon-valleys-gender-gap-is-the-result-of-computer-game-marketing-20-years-ago/) from 2017 by T.L. Andrews postulates that in the early 80's women and men earning bachelors were approaching parity, however the early consumer computers were marketed as gaming devices for males, and that contributed to the current gender gap in the field.

They even reference an [Apple commercial](https://youtu.be/rxNjx_VWJ8U) that has boys teasing girls about their computer skills.

There's even a **Game Boy** handheld gaming device. The marketing is quite clear. This led to a cyclic link between advertisers and male gamers. Marketers kept marketting at boys because they were the ones playing games, and boys kept playing games because they were the ones being marketed to.

This cascaded into males being mroe exposed to computers over time, when compared to females. Men were able to test into more advanced college programs than women because of this uneven exposure, thus gaining advantage.

Then the male dominant culture self-reinforces, and the cycle continues.
