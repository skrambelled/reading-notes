# Regular Expressions in Python

`import re` - the library for regex in python

We've already learned about regex, so feel free to refresh yourself on the syntax.

---

Some usefule `re` methods:

- `compile()`
- `search()`
- `group()`
- `findall()`
- `sub()`
- `split()`

---

We've also seen how to use `f"strings"` to indicate a sting literal is being formatted.
Similarly, `r"strings"` are indicating that they are a reaw string literal. In a raw string literal special characters like a `\` are treated as normal characters rather than as a escape character.
