# Whiteboarding

Whiteboarding is a critical part of the hiring process and also any project. It's a communication tool both for yourself and also for the team with whom you are working.

Some key points one whiteboarding:

Communicate! This means do not just start solving a problem, but instead restate the problem so that everyone is on the same page. State edge cases, ask clarifying questions. Ask about testing.

Then write some psuedocode, but not actual code. We're trying to get at the problem first from a more human perspective so that everyone can be clear on what the solution will eventually be, and you don't get caught up in the syntax of a particular language. Ask if this pseudocode makes sense.

Finally, start writing real code.

Some additional tips:

1. Take time to think things over, but let your interviewer know that's what you are doing. Talking and thinking about something technical at the same time can come out a bit garbled, so it's ok to take a little time to ponder what's being asked.
1. Write down the steps to your algorithm
1. Write psuedocode
1. Don't get caught up in small mistakes, but instead use them as an opportunity to talk about your thought process, and hwo you might research that portion of your solution
1. Accept feedback
1. Come prepared
1. Review your work, Look for edge cases, off-by-one erros, more efficiecy, etc
