# Jupyter and NumPy

## JupyterLab

JupyterLab is a web-based UI that allows you to make Jupyter projects.

[Read the overview](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html)

## NumPy

NumPy (or numerical python) is a library for creating and managing multidimensional arrays.

NumPy is came from two older python libraries, Numeric and Numarray, being combined and then further contributed to.

When using NumPy, you can perform mathematical and logical operations on these arrays.

All elements in a NumPY array have to be of the same data type.

NumPy Arrays are 0 indexed, like normal Lists

You can slice, assign values, do math operations on NumPy arrays or even multidimensional arrays.
