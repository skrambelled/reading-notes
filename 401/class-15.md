# matplotlib

[Matplotlib](https://github.com/rougier/matplotlib-tutorial#introduction) is a common library for displaying 2d graphics in Python

It is customizable, you can set all sorts of things, like dpi, line width, color, axis, grid properties, text, ticks, etc.

You can make animations by handling the frames.
There are some really excellent examples, and tutorials online, so look them up and follow along.

There are also lots of projects that you can build from, for example you can use a basemap, and then render any number of interesting data on top of the map, like geo coordinates of flights, or the given example from the tutorial was to show earthquakes. Really, if you can access geographic data, you can render it.
