# Web scraping

Web scraping is a way to grab data from a website.

NOTE!!! before scraping a site, please familiarize yourself with their policies, most site will not allow you to use their data commercially. Also, pace your scraping, so that you don't overwhelm the host site.

You can use the bs4 lib to grab all `<a>` tags and then begin extracting the data from the links of the site.

There are tons of practical applications for web scraping, like modelling out a website or webapp, or grabbing prices of products and making a historical record of those prices for comparison later. etc etc. Really, you name it, if you can webscrape the data it can be used (and you can be assured that big data webscrapers already exits and often comb through your data!)

this is how [https://web.archive.org/](https://web.archive.org/) works, and many other sites. there are unlimited applications for this method, just use your imagination!
