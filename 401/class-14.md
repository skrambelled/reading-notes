# Linear Regression

Linear regression is a common method of data analysis, where we look at two variables and try to establish if one variable can estimate or predict the other's outcome. As in, one is is an indepenedant variable and the outcome is dependant on that original value.

When we have only one variable predicting the outcome of anothers, this is called simple linear regression. There is also multiple linear regression, logistical regression, and more complex analysis.

In order to determine if some variable is a good predictor of outcomes within a given data set, you feed in some training data, and test against some test data.

Randomly split your data set into training data and testing data.

There are some good data plotting tools to help visualize your data set, and assess if your model is accurate, or if there are other variables that need to be considered.
